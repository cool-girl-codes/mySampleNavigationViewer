    description: |
      This workflow is triggered by the `trigger_map` workflow. It will run the
      `run_tests` workflow if the trigger map workflow is triggered by a pull request
      and the `build_apk` workflow if the trigger map workflow is triggered by a push
      to the master branch.
    workflows:
    - run_tests:
        filters:
        - pull_request: master
        - condition: '{{enveq "TEST" "true"}}'
    - build_apk:
        filters:
        - branch: master
  build_apk:
    summary: Run your Android unit tests and create an APK file to install your app
      on a device or share it with your team.
    description: The workflow will first clone your Git repository, install Android
      tools, set the project's version code based on the build number, run Android
      lint and unit tests, build the project's APK file and save it.
